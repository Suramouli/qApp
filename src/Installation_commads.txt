How to create your own qApp with qubic lite


Download the latest qlri jar file from the official release page:




Put it in a directory like /qlri and run it with:

$ java -jar qlri-[VERSION].jar -api -h localhost
Note:
The Java JDK must be installed! You can download it from here: 

Visit  in your browser to use the qubic lite web interface.



Now we set up a new qApp directory. Go to your development directory and create a new directory and go into it:

$ mkdir my-qapp && cd my-qapp
You can name your app like you want, just replace the both "my-qapp" parameter.



Now, let's create an index file:

$ touch index.html


Open it with your editor you like. I use . 

$ atom .
This opens the whole directory in the editor with the index.html inside.



Now add a headline in the index.html file to print something on the screen.

<h1>Hello World, qubic lite is awesome!</h1>


Create a meta.json file which will provide information about your qapp.

$ touch meta.json


Add this JSON object to the meta.json file and insert your data,

{
  "title": "my-qapp",
  "description": "My first decentral application",
  "url": "www.my-qapp.com",
  "version": "ql-0.4.1",
  "license": "Copyright Â©2018 < your name > (MIT)"
}


The qlri node needs a zip file, which contains the web content and the meta.json file. Let's create a helper for it! Let's include the node package manager (npm).

$ npm init


After you fill all things, it creates a package.json file like this: 

{
  "name": "my-qapp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "My first decetral application",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "<your name>",
  "license": "MIT"
}


For our helper, we add a simple script entry, which generates a zip file. Add the "zip" line to your package.json file (and don't forget the comma behind the "test"-line).

 "scripts": 
  {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "zip": "mkdir my-qapp && cp meta.json my-qapp/meta.json && cp index.html my-qapp/index.html && zip -r -X qapp.zip my-qapp && rm -rf my-qapp"
  },
This creates a new directory, copies the index.html and the meta.json file in and zip it. After that, it deletes the temporary dots folder. 



Run the zip command with:

$ npm run zip


We need a way to provide the zip file to the qlri. A nice way is a simple web server. Run this to install a web server globally.

$ npm install http-server -g


Now, you can make the whole directory accessible from the browser. 

$ http-server . -a localhost
You can visit  to see your page.



Go to your Qubic Lite Web interface to the qApps tab. 




Paste in the URL () and click install. You should see something like this: 







That's all! You did create your first small qApp. Congratulations!



The last step for this tutorial is to publish your awesome application to GitHub, so you have a prepared setup and you can share a link for your application. 



$ git init


$ git add .


$ git commit -m "Initial commit"


Go to GitHub and create a new repository, then add origin and push.


$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-reponame>.git


And upload it to GitHub:

$ git push -u origin master
